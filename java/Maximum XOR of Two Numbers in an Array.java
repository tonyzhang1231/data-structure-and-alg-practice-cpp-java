// Given a non-empty array of numbers, a0, a1, a2, … , an-1, where 0 ≤ ai < 231.

// Find the maximum result of ai XOR aj, where 0 ≤ i, j < n.

// Could you do this in O(n) runtime?

// Example:

// Input: [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]

// Output: 28

// Explanation: The maximum result is 5 ^ 25 = 28.

// This algorithm's idea is:
// to iteratively determine what would be each bit of the final result from left to right. 
// And it narrows down the candidate group iteration by iteration. e.g. assume input are a,b,c,d,...z, 
// 26 integers in total. In first iteration, if you found that a, d, e, h, u differs on the MSB
// (most significant bit), so you are sure your final result's MSB is set. Now in second iteration,
//  you try to see if among a, d, e, h, u there are at least two numbers make the 2nd MSB differs, 
//  if yes, then definitely, the 2nd MSB will be set in the final result.
//   And maybe at this point the candidate group shinks from a,d,e,h,u to a, e, h. Implicitly, 
// every iteration, you are narrowing down the candidate group, but you don't need to track 
// how the group is shrinking, you only cares about the final result.
